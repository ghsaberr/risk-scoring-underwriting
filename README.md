# Risk Scoring & Underwriting
Risk scoring and underwriting are key processes in finance and insurance that help assess and manage risk before making financial commitments.

## Risk Scoring
Risk scoring involves evaluating an individual's or entity's likelihood of fulfilling financial obligations based on historical data, behavior, and predictive analytics. This can include factors like credit history, income stability, payment patterns, and other risk indicators. The result is usually a numerical score, such as a credit score, which helps institutions quantify risk.

## Underwriting
Underwriting is the decision-making process where financial institutions, lenders, or insurers use risk scores and other criteria to determine whether to approve a loan, credit line, insurance policy, or investment. It involves analyzing the risk level and setting appropriate terms, such as interest rates, coverage limits, or required collateral, to mitigate potential losses.

Together, these processes help companies make informed decisions, minimize financial risks, and ensure fair pricing and access to financial products.
